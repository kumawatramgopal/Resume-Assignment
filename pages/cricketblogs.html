            <p><strong>Cricket</strong> is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"> Read More </a></p>

                        <p>The much-awaited Indian Premier League 2020 (IPL 2020) which was slated to start from March 29 was postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic that wreaked havoc in the world. The postponement of the marquee event left the fans sad. However, fans have a reason to cheer up now as the BCCI is keen on getting IPL 2020 underway in the September-November window according to recent reports...<a href="https://www.republicworld.com/sports-news/cricket-news/bcci-ceo-claims-ipl-2020-international-stars-possibility-post-rains.html"> Read More </a></p>

                        <p>The mens T20 Cricket World Cup, which was due to begin in Australia in October, could be deferred until 2022 because of the coronavirus pandemic.
                            That is one option which is on the table for discussion when the ICC Board meets on May 28th by video conference.                            
                            At present there are three possible scenarios for holding the event. The first is that it will go ahead as planned on October 18th, with all players entering Australia having to spend 14 days in quarantine first, and with crowds allowed in the stadiums...<a href="https://www.sportspundit.com/cricket/articles/13456-twenty20-world-cup-could-be-deferred"> Read More </a></p>

                        <p>In what could be the biggest news for cricket fans across the globe amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is looking at a possibility of hosting the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League from September 25 to November 1, provided the country is able to lower the rate of coronavirus infections...<a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket-ipl-13-bcci-eyeing-september-25-to-november-1-window-618901"> Read More </a></p>

                        <p>On Sunday, the Indian government relaxed restrictions on sporting events, allowing them to resume behind closed doors in the country, and as far as cricket is concerned, it means the IPL could take place in 2020.
                            The BCCI welcomed the government's decision, but said it was premature to think about the IPL at this point. The IPL, though, can take place subject to travel restrictions being eased and a window being found for the tournament, which the BCCI postponed indefinitely in April due to the Covid-19 pandemic...<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/29186899/india-allow-sport-closed-doors-bcci-cautious-ipl-2020"> Read More </a></p>

                        <p>After BCCI apex council member Anshuman Gaekwad suggested that the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League could be held in October-November (if T20 World Cup is postponed/cancelled), board CEO Rahul Johri has also shown optimism on the same.
                           The fate of the T20 World Cup is expected to be discussed in ICC's board meeting on May 28 and a decision on the global tournament may clear the air on the possibility of IPL this year...<a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/cricket-bcci-optimistic-organising-ipl-international-players-post-monsoon-says-ceo-rahul-johri-619046"> Read More </a></p>
